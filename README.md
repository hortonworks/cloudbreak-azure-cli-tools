#Azure CLI tools

### Notes

- The project uses the Azure Xplat CLI's patched version, because the original version doesn't contain any commands to deploy a package to a cloud service and that is needed for the deploy_dash command.

## Configure Azure Resource manager application easily!

The project first creates an Active Directory application with the configured name and password and adds the permissions that are needed to call the Azure Resource Manager API.

### Usage

#### With Docker (recommended)

```
docker run -it sequenceiq/dash-deployer:1.0 arm_configure --app_name myapp --app_password password123 --subscription_id 1234-abcd-efgh-5678 --username example@company.onmicrosoft.com --password password123
```

*Options:*

**--app_name**: Your application name. Default is *app*.

**--app_password**: Your application password. Default is *password*.

**--subscription_id**: Your Azure subscription ID.

**--username**: Your Azure username.

**--password**: Your Azure password.

#### Without Docker

The script can be run without Docker, but it is not recommended (see Notes - the Docker container has all the required dependencies)

- get the patched Azure CLI by cloning it from Github: `git clone https://github.com/sequenceiq/azure-xplat-cli.git`
- checkout the `release-0.9.8` branch in the `azure-xplat-cli` directory: `git checkout release-0.9.8`
- run `npm install` in the `azure-xplat-cli` directory
- set the `AZURE_CLI_LOCATION` environment variable to the `azure-xplat-cli` directory

**Example:**

```
AZURE_CLI_LOCATION=../azure-xplat-cli ./cli_tools arm_configure --app_name myapp --app_password password123 --subscription_id 1234-abcd-efgh-5678 --username example@company.onmicrosoft.com --password password123
```

## Deploy DASH easily!

DASH deployer is a small project that can be used to easily deploy Microsoft's [DASH](https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/Dash) project to an Azure cloud service.
The project first creates the namespace account and the scaleout storage accounts, builds the *.cscfg* configuration file based on the created storage account names and keys, generates an Account Name and an Account Key for the DASH service and finally deploys the cloud service package file to a new cloud service.

### Notes

- The generated Azure resource names include a 12 characters long alphanumeric hash because storage account names should be globally unique in Azure.

### Usage

#### With Docker (recommended)

```
docker run -it sequenceiq/dash-deployer:1.0 deploy_dash --accounts 5 --prefix dash --location "West Europe" --instances 3 --username example@company.onmicrosoft.com --password password123
```

*Options:*

**--accounts**: The number of *scaleout* storage accounts to create. The number specified here doesn't include the namespace storage account. Default is *5*.

**--prefix**: The name prefix of the storage accounts and cloud service that will be created by the tool. Must be between 1 and 10 characters, only numbers and lowercase letters are accepted. Default is *dash*.

**--location**: The Azure region where the resources will be created. Default is *West Europe*.

**--instances**: The number of virtual machines to create in the cloud service. Default is *1*.

**--username**: Your Azure username.

**--password**: Your Azure password.

#### Without Docker

The script can be run without Docker, but it is not recommended (see Notes - the Docker container has all the required dependencies)

- get the patched Azure CLI by cloning it from Github: `git clone https://github.com/sequenceiq/azure-xplat-cli.git`
- checkout the `release-0.9.8` branch in the `azure-xplat-cli` directory: `git checkout release-0.9.8`
- run `npm install` in the `azure-xplat-cli` directory
- set the `AZURE_CLI_LOCATION` environment variable to the `azure-xplat-cli` directory
- set the `CSCONFIG_FILE` variable to a local path, where the `.cscfg` file will be created

**Example:**

```
AZURE_CLI_LOCATION=../azure-xplat-cli CSCONFIG_FILE=./ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg ./cli_tools deploy_dash --accounts 5 --prefix dash --location "West Europe" --instances 3 --username example@company.onmicrosoft.com --password password123
```
